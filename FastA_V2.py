    V2.1  17 April 2020, Python 3.x conversion.
    This is a slightly smarter version of our previous FastA module. It is still not very careful about what
    properly constitutes a FastA sequence -- the big difference here is that we have made the class iterable by
    implementing the __iter__ and __next__ methods.
    In other words, I can now iterate over the fastA sequences present in some file, without having to first load
    each sequence into memory. The class takes an argument that is a filepath and each iteration will return the next
    (header, sequence) tuple in turn.  Probably this class could be improved by figuring out how to use the filehandle
    with a context manager -- right now the filehandle is used by multiple methods, so it's not clear to me how this
    might be accomplished.

        __next__ in Python 3.x is the key required method of an iterable class. It must simply return the
        next item in a sequence, or, if there are no more items, it should raise a StopIteration exception.
        Note that this implies that a normal loop in Python is actually ended, under-the-hood, by the error-handling
        mechanism! In the case of this next method, notice that the file handle is actually created in the __init__
        method and is held in an instance variable. That means that the current location of the read pointer in the
        file (indeed, the filehandle object itself) will remain persistent so long as the FastA object exists.
